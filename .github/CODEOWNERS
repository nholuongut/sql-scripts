# Good in theory, to alert on PR changes to these code paths, but for public repos which may be forked and run .github/workflows/fork-update.yaml, this will result in a lot of spam

# Tips:
#
# * includes changes under .github/
# dir/* only matches first level file changes but doesn't recurse
# dir/ recurses
#
# - CODEOWNERS in base branch of PR determines review request
# - paths are case sensitive
# - last match wins, use * at top for overall owner then override with more specific teams
